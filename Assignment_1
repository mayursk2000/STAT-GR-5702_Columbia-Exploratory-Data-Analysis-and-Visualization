You will be working together to get up to speed on the "10 Essentials" found here: https://edav.info/learning_R.html

### 1. Meet your group

Who are the members of your group? Tell me a bit about everyone. Where and when did you meet to work on this assignment? Include a group selfie or (Zoom screenshot). 

### 2. Install R and RStudio

If they're already installed, update to the latest versions. Run this code:

```{r}
R.version$version.string
```

Run this line *in the Console* and copy and paste the results below.

`rstudioapi::getVersion()`


### 3. Get comfortable with RStudio.
Install the **tidyverse** collection of packages as well as **devtools**. Run this code:

```{r}
find.package("tidyverse")
find.package("devtools")
```

### 4. Nuts and Bolts

Get comfortable with vectors and data frames. Create a data frame called `df` below with columns that are each a different data type: integer, numeric, character, logical, and factor. Run the code:

```{r}
# Add your data frame here
 
str(df)
```

### 5. Make some graphs with ggplot2

Use data from the *bad_drivers* dataset in the **fivethirtyeight** package.

No rules... have fun!

### 6. Practice using the main **dplyr** verbs for data transformation.
Try out the following `filter()`, `select()`, `mutate()`, `arrange()`, `group_by` and `summarize()` using data from the *foul_balls* dataset in the **fivethirtyeight** package.


### 7. Summary

Describe any questions / issues that came up and the solutions. 

Describe AI use, including screenshots, model names/versions as relevant. What helped? What didn't?
